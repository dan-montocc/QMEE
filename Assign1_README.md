Purpose: Assignment 1 for QMEE (708) Course

Dataset: `SpeciesData_Consol.csv`

Description: This dataset is a consolidation and overview of a larger dataset, collected by myself and past researchers in the PCF lab. The main variables collected were plant species name, and the respective water depth each species was found to be growing at in a given coastal wetland site in the Laurentian Great Lakes region. This information was used to calculate the Wetland Macrophyte Index (WMI) score of the wetland sampled.

Metadata for this data can be found by reading the file `Assign1_metadata.pdf`

<!-- BMB: probably don't need to say where it is since we can assume reader is in the repo already?  It's too bad the metadata are in PDF, not in a machine-readable format ...

Questions of interest: While I am hoping to perform more complex analysis with the complete dataset, which needs to digitized (once access to the appropriate files can be given in LSB); I do have some initial biological questions I would like to explore with `SpeciesData_Consol.csv`. 

Specifically, I would like to see whether Lake Huron water levels affect the total number of species present in a given wetland, as well as the number of species found in different functional/ecological groups? I predict that with increasing water levels, the number of emergent species present should decrease, while the number of submergent species should increase with increasing water levels. I also predict that the occurrence of terrestrial plant species should increase with increasing lake levels, as the meadow and high-marsh zones become inundated with water, and then become included in our dataset more due to our sampling protocols requiring all aquatic areas of a wetland to be sampled. In order to test these hypotheses, I will likely need to perform a linear regression of these variables against water level (after the assumptions of this test have been  checked for no violations.)

<!-- BMB: can you say more about the _scientific_ reasons for these questions? These are framed as statistical questions (with expected directions of effect, which is very good), but I would be curious to know why these trends matter to you ...

Avoid asking "does X affect Y?" - because the answer is almost always "yes" for any ecological system where you have bothered to measure both X and Y. "How much does X affect Y?" "In what direction does X change when Y changes?" "Can we clearly distinguish the effect of X on Y?" and "Does X affect Y enough to be important for scientific or management reasons?" are all better questions.
