Purpose: Assignment 1 for QMEE (708) Course

Dataset: SpeciesData_Consol.csv

Description: This dataset is a consolidation and overview of a larger dataset, collected by myself and past researchers in the PCF lab. The main variables collected were plant species name, and the respective water depth each species was found to be growing at in a given coastal wetland site in the Laurentian Great Lakes region. This information was used to calculate the Wetland Macrophyte Index (WMI) score of the wetland sampled. 

[For more information see: Croft, M. V., Chow-Fraser, P., 2007. Use and development of the wetland macrophyte index to detect water quality impairment in fish habitat of Great Lakes coastal marshes. J. Great Lakes Res. 33, 172â€“197. https://doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[172:UADOTW]2.0.CO;2]

Metadata for this data can be found by reading the file Assign1_metadata.pdf in my GitRepo: QMEE-journey.

Questions of interest: While I am hoping to perform more complex analysis with the complete dataset, which needs to digitized (once access to the appropriate files can be given in LSB); I do have some initial biological questions I would like to explore with SPeciesData_Consol.csv. 

Specifically, I would like to see whether Lake Huron water levels effect the total number of species present in a given wetland, as well as the number species found in different functional/ecological groups? I predict that with increasing water levels, the number of emergent species present should decrease, while the number of submergent species should increase with increasing water levels. I also predict that the occurrence of terrestrial plant species should increase with increasing lake levels, as the meadow and high-marsh zones become inundated with water, and then become included in our dataset more due to our sampling protocols requiring all aquatic areas of a wetland to be sampled. In order to test these hypotheses, I will likely need to perform a linear regression of these variables against water level (after the assumptions of this test have been  checked for no violations.)
