Question 1:
 
You pick a person from this population at random, and test them, and the test is positive.
What is the probability that they have MMV?

Solution:

Need to know ~ False positive rate (FPR), False negative rate (FPN), Prevalence (P(MMV))

Given ~ FPR, Sensitivity, P(MMV)

FPR = 5%
FNR = 100% - sensitivity = 0%
P (MMV) = 1%

Assuming we have a popluation of 100 000 people, then we can determine the probability that the random person selected tests positive 
and has MMV - P(MMV|positive)

+---------------+-------+---------+---------+
|               | MMV   | Healthy | TOTALS  |
+---------------+-------+---------+---------+
| Actual Status | 1 000 |  99 000 | 100 000 |
+---------------+-------+---------+---------+
| Positive Test | 1 000 |   4 950 |   5 950 |
+---------------+-------+---------+---------+
| Negative Test |     0 |  94 050 |  94 050 |
+---------------+-------+---------+---------+

Using the numbers from the table:
P(MMV|positive) = # of positive tests for people with MMV/total # of tests performed
P(MMV|positive) = 1000/5950 = 16.81% 
Therefore, for this test P(MMV|positive) or the positive predictive value is approximately 17%.


Question 2:

You learn that your friend has a positive rapid test for MMV. What do you tell them?

I would tell them that they should probably retest to confirm that this is not a false positive, as there is actually only a 17% chance that have MMV;
or in other words, there is a 83% chance that you do not have MMV, even though the test was positive. I would also probably say that even though there
is a small chance that they may have MMV, wanting to make mathematical models to describe biological phenomena is not the worst to disease to have,
and can be seen as a helpful compulsion to some people. ;) That being said, these rates are based on the assumption that people with MMV and those without, are as
equally likely to be tested. The more realistic scenario is that only those with symptoms of MMD are more likely to go and be tested then those
without symptoms.
